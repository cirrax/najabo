SRV lookup support in Net::XMPP
===============================

Net::XMPP did not support SRV records to get the XMPP server of the
users JID. XMPP requires the client to lookup the server by SRV records
in the DNS. See also the following bug reports including a fix:

    http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=18539#txn-249050
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=325658

To get SRV lookup work, you must have at least

    Net::XMPP >= 1.02_02
    XML::Stream >= 1.23_04

installed and enable the following lines in your najabo.conf:

    $xmpp_conf{'componentname'} = $xmpp_conf{'hostname'};
    $xmpp_conf{'srv'} = 1;
